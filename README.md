# Project Finder

This is a simple project designed to get my bearings with golang.

The goal is that this app will provide me with a simple command line
interface that i can use to find projects on my local machine, this should
allow me to better organise projects without having to deal with repeating
"cd" 15 times

I hope I can make that little gopher proud!
